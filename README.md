# My Personal Portfolio

This repository hosts the source code for my personal portfolio website, a dynamic platform showcasing my skills and projects. Built with a focus on modern web development practices, it combines a responsive and engaging front-end with a robust Django-powered back-end.

## Tech Stack

* **Frontend:**
    * **HTML5:** For structuring the content and semantic markup.
    * **CSS3:** For styling, layout, and ensuring a responsive design across various devices.
    * *(Optional: Add specific CSS frameworks if you used them, e.g., "Bootstrap 5", "Tailwind CSS")*

* **Backend:**
    * **Python:** The core programming language.
    * **Django:** A high-level Python web framework used for handling dynamic content, forms, and potentially connecting to a database for project data, blog posts, or contact forms.

## Features

* **Responsive Design:** Optimized for seamless viewing on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
* **Dynamic Content:** Content potentially managed and served from the Django backend (e.g., project details, blog entries, contact form submissions).
* **Clean & Modern UI:** A visually appealing and intuitive user interface.
* **Project Showcase:** Dedicated sections to highlight personal projects with descriptions and links.
* **About Me Section:** Information about my skills, experience, and professional background.
* **Contact Form:** (If implemented) A way for visitors to get in touch.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/YourPortfolioRepoName.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/YourPortfolioRepoName.git)
    cd YourPortfolioRepoName
    ```
2.  **Set up the Django backend:**
    * Create a virtual environment (recommended):
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    * Install dependencies:
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
        *(You'll need to create a `requirements.txt` file by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt` in your activated virtual environment after installing all Django and other Python packages.)*
    * Apply database migrations:
        ```bash
        python manage.py migrate
        ```
    * (Optional) Create a superuser to access the Django admin:
        ```bash
        python manage.py createsuperuser
        ```
    * Run the development server:
        ```bash
        python manage.py runserver
        ```
    The application should now be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.
